# scoreboard
finished scoreboard + leaderboard code for a public outreach project
The new_scoreboard for quantum wars .ipynb file is the important one here. the rest are sound effects or images to make the ui look better which must be downloaded
the arduino laser input is simulated in its own .ipynb file so both are ran at the same time to essentially simulate a game
Virtual serial ports were made to test but this should work for any serial port connection specifying port names on the devices you are using
